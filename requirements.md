## Notes for Developers

### Design Considerations
1. **Background Gradients**: The hero and some sections use soft gradient overlays with circular blur effects. These can be achieved with CSS radial gradients and pseudo-elements.

2. **Image Overlays**: Product images often have decorative frames or shapes overlaying them. Use absolute positioning and z-index for layering.

3. **Icons**: Feature icons appear to be simple line/filled icons. Use Font Awesome, Bootstrap Icons, or inline SVG.

4. **Animations** (Optional): Consider subtle fade-in animations for sections on scroll using Intersection Observer API or AOS library.

5. **CTA Buttons**: Primary buttons are solid blue with white text. Ensure hover states are defined (slightly darker blue).

6. **Typography Weight**: Mix of regular (400), semi-bold (600), and bold (700) weights throughout.

### Content Notes
- Replace placeholder images with actual product photography
- Ensure all copy is final and approved before launch
- Add proper meta tags (title, description, OG tags) for SEO
- Include structured data for products (Schema.org)

### WordPress Embedding
To embed in WordPress:
1. Copy entire HTML from `<body>` content
2. Paste into Custom HTML block
3. Optionally add custom CSS to Customizer → Additional CSS
4. Or use in page template file
